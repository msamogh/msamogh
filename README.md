# Hi, I'm Amogh Mannekote! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at the University of Florida. My research lies at the intersection of **Dialogue** and **HCI**. I also like to build and contribute to **open-source** software tools and libraries that help my fellow ML engineers and researchers.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively looking for Research Internship openings for Summer 2023.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help. I am very much open to new research ideas and collaborations.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me at [msamogh@gmail.com](msamogh@gmail.com) (more social links at the bottom).

## Research
How to leverage large language models and transfer learning techniques to bootstrap dialogue systems for **_understudied dialogue paradigms_ such as negotiation, collaboration, and tutoring**?


## Open-Source Projects
<!-- I have developed a multiple open-source tools and libraries for ML practitioners. -->

- **[nonechucks](https://github.com/msamogh/nonechucks)**: nonechucks is is a library that provides wrappers for PyTorch's datasets, samplers, and transforms to allow for dropping unwanted or invalid samples dynamically.
- **[Rasa Frames](https://github.com/msamogh/rasa-frames)**: Most dialogue state trackers only support _one value per slot_. Rasa Frames is a proof-of-concept fork of Rasa Core that supports multiple _frames_ that allows for multiple values per slot. This is helpful, for example, when the user is comparing two flights.
